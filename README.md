# sklearn-symbolic-regression
Stack based symbolic regression using Scikit-learn estimator base classes.

## This project

It works! But I doubt you will want to use it yet.

I am using this repo as a staging area for the project before I move the entire codebase into a sklearn pull request. If you really want to use it before then, open issue letting me know I will spend some time making this code easier to use and install as a package.

## Roadmap

Check out the project board if you want to get a sense of what is left to do.
